# Gifty
Gifty is a simple gif browser connected to the [Giphy /trending API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#trending). Browse gifs and tap your favorites to see them in full screen.

## Architecture
My chosen architecture for this project is Model-View-Presenter.
* ["iOS Swift MVP Architecture"](https://saad-eloulladi.medium.com/ios-swift-mvp-architecture-pattern-a2b0c2d310a3)
* ["Implement MVP in Swift 5"](https://betterprogramming.pub/implement-a-model-view-presenter-architecture-in-swift-5-dfa21bbb8e0b)

In this architecture, we'll have a model layer that is updated by a service, a presentation layer that uses the service to reach the model and transforms it into a presentable format for the view layer, and the view layer which is responsible for displaying our transformed model. Similar to MVVM, the view controller is considered part of the view layer and should contain no model logic. Instead, that responsibility is shifted to the Presenter.

The implementation in this project makes use of a delegate to communicate the result of the Presenter to the view layer. If communication were required from the view layer to the Presenter, such as if we needed to capture user input into a text field for example, a delegate could also be used to transmit the updated text back through the Presenter and on to the model.

This delegate pattern of object communication serves a similar function to data binding and observables in MVVM. 

As this is a fairly small project, with limited user input and navigation, I opted for MVP to acheive desired code separation, and for the simplicity of implementating the delegate communication pattern. 

To handle pagination, the app uses a combination of pre-fetching and reloading an intersection of a new page's indexPaths and the collectionView's visible index paths to provide a continuous scrolling experience, as laid out in [this great tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5786-uitableview-infinite-scrolling-tutorial).

## Dependencies
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)
* [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) (Tracked by the repo)
* An API key, which can be obtained by [registering an app with Giphy.](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true)

## Requirements
* Place your API key in the included [APIConfig.xcconfig](https://github.com/bryantm1123/Gifty/blob/master/Gifty/APIConfig.xcconfig) file, in the API_KEY field:

    `API_KEY = {YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE}`

* iOS Deployment target: 14.5
* Xcode 12.5+

## Known Issues/Challenges
* **Duplicate Gifs**: Mentioned in [GifFeedPresenter.swift](https://github.com/bryantm1123/Gifty/blob/master/Gifty/GifFeed/Presenter/GifFeedPresenter.swift) lines 73 - 80 with link to relevant Github issue. I first noticed duplicates when testing the UI, and after checking the app code, I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com) and [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io) to debug the API response and found that there are indeed occasionally duplicates returned from the API.
* **Inconsistent Pagination Total**: Mentioned in [GifFeedPresenter.swift](https://github.com/bryantm1123/Gifty/blob/master/Gifty/GifFeed/Presenter/GifFeedPresenter.swift) lines 54 - 67 with link to relevant Github issues. This one was a fun debugging challenge üòÅ. In the pagination strategy mentioned above, a key component is tracking the total count of items available from the service (GifFeedPresenter line 67, [GifFeedDataSource](https://github.com/bryantm1123/Gifty/blob/master/Gifty/GifFeed/Presenter/GifFeedDataSource.swift) line 33) and using it to inform the collectionview data source's number of items. My initial implementation had the presenter's count tracking variable update with each new request. But this lead to internal inconsistency errors from the collection view's attempt to reload our new calculated indexPaths. The root cause turned out to be the slight variations between total_count values returned by different requests to the service. This may or may not be expected behavior, I couldn't really tell for sure from the responses to the linked Github issues, so I put in a fix that sets the GifFeedPresenter's count tracker from the first request.
* **Indexing incorrect image** Mentioned in [GifFeedViewController](https://github.com/bryantm1123/Gifty/blob/master/Gifty/GifFeed/Views/GifFeedViewController.swift) lines 115 - 126. In some semi-rare cases I've noticed that tapping on a gif can show a different gif in the detail view. There seems to be an indexing issue or perhaps cell re-use issue at play. The cell's prepare for reuse method is being called seemingly when it should and the cells seem to be updating as expected during the scroll. With duplicates occasionally returning from the API, there may be an underlying re-use issue that is a little harder to spot.
